## Introduction

Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) combines visual data from cameras with inertial measurements from sensors. The Voxel SVIO system uses a voxel map to represent the environment, allowing for robust and efficient localization and mapping. This method provides improved accuracy over traditional odometry techniques, making it suitable for complex environments.

## Features

- **Stereo Vision**: Utilizes two cameras for depth perception.
- **Voxel Mapping**: Efficiently represents 3D environments.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes data quickly for real-time applications.
- **Robustness**: Handles challenging conditions like low light and fast motion.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the MIT License.

## Installation

To set up the Voxel SVIO system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbernalfa/voxel_svio.git
   cd voxel_svio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x and pip installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Compile the project using:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the System**:
   Execute the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the Voxel SVIO system, you need to set up your camera and inertial sensors. Hereâ€™s a simple guide:

1. **Connect the Cameras**: Ensure both cameras are connected and recognized by your system.
2. **Calibrate Sensors**: Use the provided calibration tools to align the cameras and inertial sensors.
3. **Start the System**: Run the main program as described in the installation section.
4. **Monitor Output**: View the odometry results in real-time on your display.
